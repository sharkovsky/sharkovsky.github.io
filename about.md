I like to consider myself an eclectic scientist, skeptic and critical thinker.
Currently my main interests are programming, data science and biological neural
networks.

I am currently pursuing a PhD at EPFL, focusing on the computational complexity
and runtime performance of simulations of biological neural networks.  I am
using analytical performance models of software and hardware to explain the
relationship between computer architectures and simulations of the brain.

When I'm not yelling at my computer screen, I'm either taking travel photos,
playing basketball or bullying my fingers into playing the guitar.
