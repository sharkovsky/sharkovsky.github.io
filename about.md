Computational neuroscience PhD, focusing on the computational complexity
and runtime performance of simulations of biological neural networks. 
I'm interested in machine learning applications for good, such as
improving healthcare, sustainability and fairness in society.

When I'm not yelling at my computer screen, I'm either taking travel photos,
playing basketball or bullying my fingers into playing the guitar.
